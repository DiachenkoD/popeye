<h3>Popeye @version@ help system</h3>


<h4>Introduction</h4>

  Popeye is a graphical Java (swing) application for managing java language
  bundles. Such bundles consists of a set of properties files. Each file
  contains a special language translation in a key=value style. For every key
  there is a language dependent translation (value). Popeye reads all files
  and collect these values for the keys. Now the user can edit, resort, remove
  or insert new entries.
  Another feature of Popeye is the unicode support. All values can include
  language dependent characters. These characters are coded in an unreadable
  format, like \u00EF. Popeye can encode/decode such characters.
  I can't found an application, which take care of this problem. But a lot
  of (powerfull) properties editors for single files.
