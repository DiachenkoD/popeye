<br>
Taken from the Java specification:<br>

 When saving properties to a stream or loading them from a stream, the
 ISO 8859-1 character encoding is used. For characters that cannot be directly
 represented in this encoding,
 <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/html/3.doc.html#100850">Unicode escapes</a>
 are used; however, only a single 'u' character is allowed in an escape sequence.
 The native2ascii tool can be used to convert property files to and from
 other character encodings.<br>
