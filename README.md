Popeye is a tool for the handling of Java (TM) property files for message internationalization ( I18N ). The included editor-component has full UTF support and can handle all translations ( properties files ) from a java resource bundle.

This project is a fork from [the Popeye at sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/popeye/).

Binaries can be downloaded from [the JabRef translation page](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/translation.php).
